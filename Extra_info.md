Make sure to download the pretrained weights for EVA-02-L from ``EVA-02-det`` and place them under the `pretrained_models` directory. The pretrained weights can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/Yuxin-CV/EVA-02/blob/main/eva02/det/eva02_L_coco_det_sys_o365.pth).

We provide the pretrained weights for the Local Human Artifact Detection Model (HADM-L) and Global Human Artifact Detection Model (HADM-G) models to reproduce the results presented in the paper. The pretrained weights can be downloaded from the following links:
